.Nd provide OATH-compatible one-time password authentication types
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm login_otp
.Op Fl s Ar service
.Op Fl v Cm wheel Ns = Ns Cm yes Ns | Ns Cm no
.Op Fl v Cm lastchance Ns = Ns Cm yes Ns | Ns Cm no
.Ar user
.Op Ar class
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is called by
.Xr login 1 ,
.Xr su 1 ,
.Xr ftpd 8 ,
and others to authenticate the
.Ar user
with a combined one-time password (OTP) and passwd-style authentication.
.Pp
The OTP is compatible to the standards that have been specified by the
Initiative for Open Authentication (OATH):
either the HMAC-Based One-Time Password Algorithm (HOTP, RFC 4226) or
the Time-Based One-Time Password Algorithm (TOTP, RFC 6238).
.Pp
The OTP can be configured with the
.Xr otp 1
utility.
The
.Nm
utility can be called as
.Nm login_otp ,
.Nm login_hotp ,
or
.Nm login_totp
to either allow HOTP or TOTP passwords,
or to enforce HTOP or TOTP passwords accordingly,
or as
.Nm login_otp_only ,
.Nm login_hotp_only ,
or
.Nm login_totp
to only require the HOTP or TOTP password without being combined with
the user's system password.
.Pp
The
.Ar user
argument is the login name of the user to be authenticated.
.Pp
The
.Ar service
argument specifies which protocol to use with the
invoking program.
The allowed protocols are
.Em login ,
.Em challenge ,
and
.Em response .
(The
.Em challenge
protocol is silently ignored but will report success as passwd-style
authentication is not challenge-response based).
.Pp
If the
.Cm wheel
argument is specified and is not set to
.Cm yes ,
then the user will be rejected as not being in group
.Dq wheel .
This is used by
.Xr su 1 .
.Pp
If the
.Cm lastchance
argument is specified and is equal to
.Cm yes ,
then if the user's password has expired, and it has not been
expired longer than
.Dq password-dead
seconds (see
.Xr login.conf 5 ) ,
the user will be able to log in one last time to change the password.
.Pp
.Nm
will prompt the user for a password and report back to the invoking
program whether or not the authentication was successful.
The format of the password is a concatenated string including a valid OTP
and the system user password, for example OTP
.Sq Ar 123456
and password
.Sq Ar test-123 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
login: user
OTP + password for "user":123456test-123
.Ed
.Pp
When invoked as
.Nm login_otp_only ,
.Nm login_hotp_only ,
or
.Nm login_totp_only ,
only the OTP password is required:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
login: user
OTP for "user":123456
.Ed
.Pp
The user obtains a valid OTP from an OATH-compatible external authenticator,
typically a token, hardware dongle, or authenticator mobile app,
such as the
.Dq Google Authenticator .
.Pp
As documented in
.Xr login.conf 5 ,
local authentication styles and program names should start with a dash (-):
.Em login_-otp, login_-totp, login_-hotp, login_-otp_only, login_-totp_only,
.Em login_-hotp_only, -otp .
